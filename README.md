# Hands on Rust
Following along ["Hands-on Rust" book](https://hands-on-rust.com/)

## Running

With the latest stable [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), go into any sub-directory and run `cargo run`

## Goals

Finish the book and its implementations, and then attempt to add testing and other features on the projects.
Will seperate new work with the old implementation for reference checking.
